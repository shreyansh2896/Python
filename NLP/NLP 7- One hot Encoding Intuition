D1) The food is good                                 Distinct 7 unique words or vocabularies --> The, food, is, good, bad,pizza,amazing
D2) The food is bad                                                                               1    0     0   0    0    0     0
D3) Pizza is amazing                                                                              0    1     0   0    0    0     0


For D1 We have 4*7 matrix

[[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ],
[0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ],
[0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ],
[0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ]]


For D2 also We have 4*7 matrix

[[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ],
[0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ],
[0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ],
[0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]]                      ## [0 0 0 0 1 0 0 ] represents bad as it is coming at 5th position.


For D2 We have 3*7 matrix since there are 3 unique words in d3.



## Advantages of OHE
1) Easy to implement [in python we can use sklearn,pd.get_dummies()]


## Disadvantage of OHE
1) Sparse matrix (A sparse matrix is a matrix where most of the elements are zero) --> This leads to overfitting
2) For ML algorithm we need Fixed size input. (for d1 & d2 size is 4*7 but for d3 it is 3*7).
3) No Semnatic Meaning is captured.(Eg: food and good, how these 2 words are related or how much is the similarity of the words these information will not be captured becase at the end we are only getting 1's and 0's).
4) Out of vocabulary (OOV). (if a new word comes as a test dataset and we don't have any such vector representation of the new word then it will not work.
5) More the number of different vocabularies more will be the number of variables and more will be the number of 1's and 0's.
